        "info": "The Sun is the star at the center of our Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible light and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. | The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star based on its spectral class. As such, it is informally and not completely accurately referred to as a yellow dwarf. It formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process. | In its core the Sun currently fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second, converting 4 million tons of matter into energy every second as a result. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape the core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat. When hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished sufficiently, its core will increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become large enough to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus, and make Earth uninhabitable â€“ but not for about five billion years. After this, it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known as a white dwarf, and no longer produce energy, but still glow and give off heat. ",

        "info": "Mercury is the smallest and closests planet to the sun. Its orbit is the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the Greek god Hermes, translated into latin as Mercurius, god of commerce, messenger of the gods, mediator between gods and mortals. | Mercury's surface is imilar in apperance to that of the Moon, showing extensive mare-like plains and heavy-cratering, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years.| Mercury has the most eccentric orbit of all the planets; its eccentricity is 0.21 with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46,000,000 to 70,000,00 km. | The first telescopic observations of Mercury were made by Galileo in the early 17<sup>th</sup> century. | A rare event in astronomy is the passage of one planet in front of another (called an occulation), as seen from earth. Mercury and Venus occult each other every few centuries, and the event of May 28, 1737 is the only historically observed. having seen by John Bevis at the Royal Greenwich Observatory. The next occulation of Mercury by Venus will be on December 3, 2133. | Reaching Mercury from Earth poses significant technical challenges, because it orbits so much closer to the Sun than Earth. A Mercury-bound spacecraft launched from Earth must travel over 91 million kilometres into the Sun's gravitational potential well. Mercury has an orbital speed of 48 km/s, whereas Earth's orbital speed is 30 km/s . Therefore, the spacecraft must make a large change in velocity (delta-v) to get to Mercury and then enter orbit, as compared to the delta-v required for other planetary missions. | <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)\">More Info Here</a>",
